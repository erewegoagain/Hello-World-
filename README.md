# Hello-World-Overview
This is a simple software program that prints: "Hello World!", some information about me, and a hopeful message.

This is a very simple and basic program, but its main purporse it to help set up a portfolio for our coding and showcase how to use Github.

(I don't believe we will need a video demonstration here)

# Development Environment

The main tool I used was Microsoft VS Code, making sure to install some librarys to help it support Python.

Python was the programming language I used for this project. It was my first time using it
